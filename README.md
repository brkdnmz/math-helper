# [Math Helper](https://brkdnmz.github.io/math-helper)

### This small app lets you see some properties about integers.

Currently, the properties are:

- **Number of digits**
- **Factorization**
- **Number of divisors**
- **Is it prime?**
- **Number of primes up to the number**
- **Previous prime**
- **Next prime**

Also, additional properties will be added :)

Special thanks to [muratbiberoglu](https://github.com/muratbiberoglu) for helping me deploy the app!
